# Bo-MA-CNN-BiLSTM NetWork
In this study, we propose the Bo-MA-BiLSTM model, which integrates multi-head attention with two-dimensional convolution and bidirectional BiLSTM networks to extract feature data in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, we apply Bayesian optimization to fine-tune the model parameters.The dataset utilized comprises five different types of well logging data, including neutron, density, gamma-ray, resistivity, and Vp (compressional wave velocity).The dataset employed in this study consists of test data.
## We attempt to answer the following research questions:
 RQ1: How to apply the core code block of the Bo-MA-BiLSTM model?
 RQ2: How to utilize the model outputs to visualize prediction results effectively?
 RQ3: How to utilize Pearson correlation coefficient and least squares method for correlation analysis and visualize different feature data?
 RQ4: How to utilize Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning? 
The study compared and demonstrated the construction and implementation process of five different neural network models: CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Bo-MA-BiLSTM. It also presented the visualization of their gradient convergence. Furthermore, it compared their differences in shear wave prediction performance.
